        <p>
          I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what this is for.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Future lecture notes for the hopeful possibility that one day I am teaching a course over this material.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Current notes for students taking the first year algebra sequence. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Assistance in studying for the Algebra Qualifying Exam at UNL.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Clout.
              </p>

                  These are pretty standard and probably what you'd be expecting. The building blocks of what we'll be working with.

                <p>
                  A more technical result used specifically in the proof of a larger result.

              <li><title><term>Corollary </term></title>
                <p>
                  An important result whose proof comes directly from a previous theorem.

                <p>
                  Providing context in the form of foreshadowing or content not covered in this text.

                  In general, there shouldn't be anything defined in a remark, they should be entirely optional.

                A topological space is an ordered pair <m>(𝑋, 𝒯)</m>, where <m>𝑋</m> is a set and <m>𝒯</m> is a topology on <m>𝑋</m>.

          <historical>
            <p>
              The definition of a topological space arose from an abstraction of our familiar concepts of limits and continuity in Euclidean spaces.

          <remark>
            <p>
              Note that a set <m>𝑋</m> may admit many different topologies. 
              Then <m>(𝑋, 𝒯)</m> and <m>(𝑋, 𝒯′)</m> are different topological spaces if <m>𝒯 ≠ 𝒯′</m>, even though the underlying set <m>𝑋</m> is the same.

          <convention>
            <p>
              We use the word space to mean topological space unless otherwise noted.

              When it is clear what topology a space <m>(𝑋, 𝒯)</m> has, we will denote the space by <m>𝑋</m>.

              The properties of the sets in a topology were properties that were satisfied by the usual open sets of <m>ℝ</m>, hence the use of the term <q>open</q>.

          <p>
            We can think of a topology on <m>𝑋</m> as specifying what subsets of <m>𝑋</m> will be considered open.
          </p>

          <warning>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that open sets are elements of the topology 𝒯 and subsets of the space <m>𝑋</m>.
              Elements of <m>𝑋</m>, on the other hand, are the points of the space <m>𝑋</m>.

          <p>
            Phrased differently, 𝑝 is a limit point of 𝐴 if every open set containing 𝑝 intersects 𝐴 at some point other than 𝑝 itself. 
            Thus, the concept of a limit point gives us a way of capturing the idea of a point being “arbitrarily close” to a set without using the concept of distance. 
            Instead, we use the idea of open sets in a topology.
