        <p>
          I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what this is for.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Future lecture notes for the hopeful possibility that one day I am teaching a course over this material.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Current notes for students taking the first year algebra sequence. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Assistance in studying for the Algebra Qualifying Exam at UNL.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Clout.
              </p>

                <p>
                  These are pretty standard and probably what you'd be expecting. The building blocks of what we'll be working with.

                <p>
                  A more technical result used specifically in the proof of a larger result.

              </li>

              <li><title><term>Corollary </term></title>
                <p>
                  An important result whose proof comes directly from a previous theorem.

              </li>

              <li><title><term>Proposition </term></title>
                <p>

              <li><title><term>Exploration </term></title>

                  Generalizations, specifics, smaller results, things are are less essential to the course or results who's proofs are usually skipped.

              <li><title><term>Remark </term></title>
                <p>
                  Providing context in the form of foreshadowing or content not covered in this text.

                  In general, there shouldn't be anything defined in a remark, they should be entirely optional.

              <li><title><term>Context </term></title>
                <p>
                  Historical and etymogical origins.

                Let X(0) be a set of points with the discrete topology. For each n ≥ 1, form the space X(n) from X(n-1) by:
                For each α in an index set Jn, let Dαn be a copy of the closed unit disk Dn in ℝn (with Euclidean topology), and let φα: Sαn-1 → X(n-1) be a continuous function. Let Zn := X(n-1) ∐ (∐α ∈ Jn Dαn) have the disjoint union topology, and let ∼ be the minimal equivalence relation on this space such that d ∼ φα(d) for all d ∈ Sαn-1 and α ∈ Jn. Define X(n) be the quotient space and let qn be the quotient map.
                Let X := ∪n ∈ ℕ X(n) (where each X(n) is identified with its image in X(n+1)). If there is no n such that X = X(n), then a subset A of X is defined to be open in X if and only if A ∩ X(n) is open in X(n) for all n. The space X is a CW complex, and the topology on X is the CW topology or weak topology. The subspace X(n) of X is the n-skeleton of X. The procedure of building X(n) from X(n-1) is called gluing on n-disks.
                For each n ≥ 1 and each α ∈ Jn, let Φα : Dαn → X be the composition Φα := iX(n)X ∘ qn ∘ iDαnZn (where iX(n)X: X(n) → X and iDαnZn: Dαn → Zn are the inclusion maps). For n = 0, let J0 be a set in bijection with X(0), and for each α ∈ J0, let Dα0 = Bα0 := {∗} be a singleton space and let Φα : Dα0 → X be defined by Φα(p) := vα, the vertex in X corresponding to α. For all n ≥ 0; and α ∈ Jn, the map Φα is the characteristic map, or gluing map, or attaching map associated to α. The image eαn := Φα(Bαn) is the open n-cell of X corresponding to α.
                If there is an n ∈ ℕ such that there is an open n-cell but there are no open k-cells for any k &gt; n, then X = X(n) is n-dimensional. If there is no such n, then X is infinite dimensional.

                Let X be a PC CW complex and let p ∈ X(0) be the basepoint. Let ω:I → Sα1 be defined by ω(t) := (cos(2πt),sin(2πt)) and let ρ:I → D1 be defined by ρ(t) := 2t - 1 for all t ∈ I. Suppose that for each face (2-cell) f = eα2 of X, the map sf: I → X defined by sf := iX(1)X ∘ φα ∘ ω satisfies sf(0) ∈ X(0) and sf follows an edge path in X(1). Then a presentation for π1(X,p) can be computed as follows:
                Step 0: Choose a maximal tree T in the 1-skeleton X(1). For each vertex v of X, let tv: I → X be the (shortest) path in T from p to v.
                Step 1: For each edge e = eαe1 of X(1) outside of T, let ae be the loop in X at p defined by ae' := tΦαe(-1) ∗ be ∗ tΦαe(1)rev, where be := Φαe ∘ ρ is the path in X from Φαe(-1) to Φαe(1) that traverses the edge e. Let ae := [ae']. Then π1(X(1),p) = F({ae | e is an edge of X outside of T}).
                Step 2: For each face f = eαf2 of X(2), let rf'' := tsf(0) ∗ sf ∗ tsf(1)rev. By inserting and/or deleting path products with paths of the form e ∗ erev and erev ∗ e for edges e in T into rf'', create a path rf' that is a path product of paths of the form ae' or (ae')rev for edges e outside of T; that is, [rf'] =π1(X(1),p) rf for some word rf = ae1j1 ··· aemjm with m ≥ 0 and each ji ∈ {± 1}. Then π1(X,p) = π1(X(2),p) = \langle {ae | e is an edge of X outside of T} | {rf = 1 | f is a face of X}  \rangle.
