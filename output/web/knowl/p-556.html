<div class="para">Let X(0) be a set of points with the discrete topology. For each n ≥ 1, form the space X(n) from X(n-1) by: For each \alpha in an index set Jn, let D\alpha n be a copy of the closed unit disk Dn in \R^n (with Euclidean topology), and let φ\alpha : S\alpha n-1 \to X(n-1) be a continuous function. Let Zn := X(n-1) ∐ (∐\alpha \in Jn D\alpha n) have the disjoint union topology, and let \sim be the minimal equivalence relation on this space such that d \sim φ\alpha (d) for all d \in S\alpha n-1 and \alpha \in Jn. Define X(n) be the quotient space and let qn be the quotient map. Let X := \cup n \in \N  X(n) (where each X(n) is identified with its image in X(n+1)). If there is no n such that X = X(n), then a subset A of X is defined to be open in X if and only if A \cap X(n) is open in X(n) for all n. The space X is a CW complex, and the topology on X is the CW topology or weak topology. The subspace X(n) of X is the n-skeleton of X. The procedure of building X(n) from X(n-1) is called gluing on n-disks. For each n ≥ 1 and each \alpha \in Jn, let Φ\alpha : D\alpha n \to X be the composition Φ\alpha := iX(n)X \circ qn \circ iD\alpha nZn (where iX(n)X: X(n) \to X and iD\alpha nZn: D\alpha n \to Zn are the inclusion maps). For n = 0, let J0 be a set in bijection with X(0), and for each \alpha \in J0, let D\alpha 0 = B_\alpha 0 := {∗} be a singleton space and let Φ\alpha : D\alpha 0 \to X be defined by Φ\alpha (p) := v\alpha, the vertex in X corresponding to \alpha. For all n ≥ 0; and \alpha \in Jn, the map Φ\alpha is the characteristic map, or gluing map, or attaching map associated to \alpha. The image e\alpha n := Φ\alpha (B_\alpha n) is the open n-cell of X corresponding to \alpha. If there is an n \in \N  such that there is an open n-cell but there are no open k-cells for any k &gt; n, then X = X(n) is n-dimensional. If there is no such n, then X is infinite dimensional.</div>
