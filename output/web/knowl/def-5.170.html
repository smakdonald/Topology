<div class="para">Let X(0) be a set of points with the discrete topology. For each n ≥ 1, form the space X(n) from X(n-1) by: For each α in an index set Jn, let Dαn be a copy of the closed unit disk Dn in ℝn (with Euclidean topology), and let φα: Sαn-1 → X(n-1) be a continuous function. Let Zn := X(n-1) ∐ (∐α ∈ Jn Dαn) have the disjoint union topology, and let ∼ be the minimal equivalence relation on this space such that d ∼ φα(d) for all d ∈ Sαn-1 and α ∈ Jn. Define X(n) be the quotient space and let qn be the quotient map. Let X := ∪n ∈ ℕ X(n) (where each X(n) is identified with its image in X(n+1)). If there is no n such that X = X(n), then a subset A of X is defined to be open in X if and only if A ∩ X(n) is open in X(n) for all n. The space X is a CW complex, and the topology on X is the CW topology or weak topology. The subspace X(n) of X is the n-skeleton of X. The procedure of building X(n) from X(n-1) is called gluing on n-disks. For each n ≥ 1 and each α ∈ Jn, let Φα : Dαn → X be the composition Φα := iX(n)X ∘ qn ∘ iDαnZn (where iX(n)X: X(n) → X and iDαnZn: Dαn → Zn are the inclusion maps). For n = 0, let J0 be a set in bijection with X(0), and for each α ∈ J0, let Dα0 = Bα0 := {∗} be a singleton space and let Φα : Dα0 → X be defined by Φα(p) := vα, the vertex in X corresponding to α. For all n ≥ 0; and α ∈ Jn, the map Φα is the characteristic map, or gluing map, or attaching map associated to α. The image eαn := Φα(Bαn) is the open n-cell of X corresponding to α. If there is an n ∈ ℕ such that there is an open n-cell but there are no open k-cells for any k &gt; n, then X = X(n) is n-dimensional. If there is no such n, then X is infinite dimensional.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-presenting-spaces.html#def-5.170" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
