<div class="para">Let X be a PC CW complex and let p ∈ X(0) be the basepoint. Let ω:I → Sα1 be defined by ω(t) := (cos(2πt),sin(2πt)) and let ρ:I → D1 be defined by ρ(t) := 2t - 1 for all t ∈ I. Suppose that for each face (2-cell) f = eα2 of X, the map sf: I → X defined by sf := iX(1)X ∘ φα ∘ ω satisfies sf(0) ∈ X(0) and sf follows an edge path in X(1). Then a presentation for π1(X,p) can be computed as follows: Step 0: Choose a maximal tree T in the 1-skeleton X(1). For each vertex v of X, let tv: I → X be the (shortest) path in T from p to v. Step 1: For each edge e = eαe1 of X(1) outside of T, let ae be the loop in X at p defined by ae' := tΦαe(-1) ∗ be ∗ tΦαe(1)rev, where be := Φαe ∘ ρ is the path in X from Φαe(-1) to Φαe(1) that traverses the edge e. Let ae := [ae']. Then π1(X(1),p) = F({ae | e is an edge of X outside of T}). Step 2: For each face f = eαf2 of X(2), let rf'' := tsf(0) ∗ sf ∗ tsf(1)rev. By inserting and/or deleting path products with paths of the form e ∗ erev and erev ∗ e for edges e in T into rf'', create a path rf' that is a path product of paths of the form ae' or (ae')rev for edges e outside of T; that is, [rf'] =π1(X(1),p) rf for some word rf = ae1j1 ··· aemjm with m ≥ 0 and each ji ∈ {± 1}. Then π1(X,p) = π1(X(2),p) = \langle {ae | e is an edge of X outside of T} | {rf = 1 | f is a face of X}  \rangle.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-presenting-spaces.html#thm-5.233" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
